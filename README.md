Given our hectic schedules and examination commitments, we coordinated our efforts by scheduling meetings where all team members were present to collaboratively work on the code. However, we encountered issues with errors emerging when team members attempted to push their individual contributions to the repository. To resolve this, we consolidated our efforts by manually integrating the code from each team member into a single unified version on Akhil's laptop. This approach allowed us to thoroughly debug and refine the code collectively before committing the final version to the repository. Consequently, the repository reflects only one git push, which was executed from Akhil's account. For insights into the individual contributions of each team member, their respective tasks and progress are documented and can be reviewed on JIRA and through our daily scrum updates.
